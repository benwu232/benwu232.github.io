3. **Enhancing Speed**: Faster value adjustment compared to sliders or steppers
4. **Increasing Reliability**: Natural resistance to interference and accidental touches

## Future Development

The virtual knob technology implemented in YAP serves as a foundation for broader human-machine interaction applications, with potential expansions into:

- Automotive interfaces
- VR/AR environments  
- Desktop applications
- Smart home controls
